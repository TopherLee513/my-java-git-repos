# TicTacTux

Initial respects go to Topher513, for a spin off from his 
TicTacTux project he asked me for input on. I've slowly added
and altered his original plan, in order to decisively build 
a working gui version with full functionality and style.
This may be a work in progress and will take some time to 
gain all functionality, but will certainly be extensive in
its entirety. I've added many unused blocks only to allow 
for their use later, or ultimate elimination from this project.
